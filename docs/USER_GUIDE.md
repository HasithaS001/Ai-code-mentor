3. **Provide context**: Mention what you're trying to understand
4. **Follow up**: Ask clarifying questions if something isn't clear

### Effective Learning Strategies
1. **Start with overview**: Get a project summary before diving into details
2. **Use beginner lens**: Filter out complex files when starting
3. **Combine modes**: Read explanations, view diagrams, and listen to audio
4. **Take quizzes**: Test your understanding regularly
5. **Ask questions**: Use the chat to clarify confusing concepts

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Code Not Explaining
- **Check selection**: Make sure you've selected code properly
- **Try smaller chunks**: Large selections might be too complex
- **Refresh the page**: Sometimes a refresh helps

#### Upload Issues
- **Check file size**: Very large projects might take longer
- **Verify format**: Ensure ZIP files are properly formatted
- **Check internet**: Slow connections might cause timeouts

#### Audio Not Working
- **Check permissions**: Allow microphone access for voice input
- **Check volume**: Ensure system volume is up
- **Try different browser**: Some browsers handle audio better

## üéì Learning Pathways

### For Intermediate Learners
1. **Explore full projects**: Turn off beginner lens to see everything
2. **Study architecture**: Ask about how components work together
3. **Analyze patterns**: Look for design patterns and best practices
4. **Compare approaches**: Upload similar projects to see differences
5. **Take intermediate quizzes**: Challenge your understanding

### For Advanced Users
1. **Deep dive analysis**: Select complex algorithms and functions
2. **Architecture review**: Understand system design and structure
3. **Performance analysis**: Ask about optimization opportunities
4. **Code quality**: Discuss best practices and improvements
